### This is a noddy implementation of Interval Arithmetic using raku class Range 
- No provision is made for Rounded Interval Arithmetic
- No provision is made for [disjoint] multi-intervals
- No provision is made for complex intervals
- Only a handful of all possible Interval operations
- No use of standard libs such as [MPRIA](https://www.gnu.org/software/mpria/) or [MPFI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::MPFI)

## TODOs
### Additional arithmetic operations
- [ ] power (even / odd)
- [ ] log / exp 
- [ ] trig
### Comparison operators 
### Set operators 

_Please feel free to submit any of these as a PR_
