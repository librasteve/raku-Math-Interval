### This is a noddy implementation of Interval Arithmetic by overloading raku Range operators 
### No provision is made for Rounded Interval Arithmetic
### No provision is made for [disjoint] multi-intervals
### No provision is made for complex intervals

## TODOs
### Additional arithmetic operations
- [ ] power (even / odd)
- [ ] log / exp 
- [ ] trig

### Comparison operators 
### Set operators 
need class Interval does Range {...} ?

Please feel free to submit any of these as a PR
